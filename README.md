# CSI4810Project2

Project 2 for the course CSI 4810, focusing on text mining.

This project uses data from https://pokemondb.net/. This data was collected with the script PokeMiner.ipynb. The dataset was cleaned using the DataCleaing.ipynb script, visualized with the PokemonDataVisualization.ipynb script, and converted into the subset discussed in the report with the DataSubsetCleaningAndVisualization.ipynb script.

To run the demo application, run all the cells in the GradioProjectDemo.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file from top to bottom. 

The experimental results discussed in the project report were obtained by running the TrainTestTesting.ipynb script, though the script is designed such that certain values, such as the ones specifying the type of resampling done, must be changed manually between runs.
